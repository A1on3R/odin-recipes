This is the first project of the odin project, called odin recipes.
I'm going through the odin project to improve on my skills and be able
to build on some of my ideas. This project will be a basic recipe site to build html chops

Reflection After Completion:
I see the need to learn keyboard shortcuts to improve speed. 
Plus we need to be careful about creating everything. It is easy to create a mistep. If I want to use templates, I should know when to save and push to optimize workflow.
Tests and double checking everything will be important, as I don't want to make many small mistakes.
